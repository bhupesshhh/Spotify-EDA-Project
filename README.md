# Spotify-EDA-Project

For this exploratpry data science project, I downloaded my own spotify streaming history and tried to get different inferences and useful information I can get about my usage. I used python programming along with python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. My codes are written in jupyter notebook and I explained all the steps with specific details.
